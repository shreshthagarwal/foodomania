        <h3 class="features-h1">Travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>
        <p class="features-p">Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. <br><br><br>

          You can get COVID-19 during your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others. You and your travel companions (including children) may spread COVID-19 to other people including your
          family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus.<br><br><br>

          Don’t travel if you are sick or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Don’t travel with someone who is sick.</p>

        <h3 class="features-h1">Before you Travel</h3>
        <p class="features-p"><strong>Before you travel, consider the following: </strong><br><br><br>

          <strong>Is COVID-19 spreading at your destination? </strong><br>
          The more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when you return.<br><br>
          <strong>Do you live with someone who might be more likely to get very ill from COVID-19?</strong><br>
          If you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to loved ones when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms.<br><br>
          <strong>Are you more likely to get very ill from COVID-19?</strong><br>
          Anyone can get very ill from the virus that causes COVID-19, but older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.<br><br>
          <strong>Does your destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers?</strong><br>
          Some state, local, and territorial governments have requirements, such as requiring people to wear masks and requiring those who recently traveled to stay home for up to 14 days. Check state, territorial, tribal and local public health
          websites for information before you travel. If you are traveling internationally, check the destination’s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information
          pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="features-h1">If You Travel</h3>
        <p class="features-p"><strong>During your trip, take steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:</strong><br><br><br>

          Wear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings.<br><br>
          Avoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from anyone who is not from your household.<br><br>
          Wash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).<br><br>
          Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.<br><br>
          Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br><br></p>
